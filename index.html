				<h3>Who are we?</h3>
				<p>Dynamic Energy Group, Inc. (DEG) is an energy conservation company with MEP construction and design-build capabilities that in coordination with building and facility owner/developer can design, engineer and install high efficiency technologies intended to reduce energy costs or increase the efficiency of the existing infrastructure. DEG implements green, clean and sustainably designed projects that are technology-neutral and vendor-neutral.</p><p>
 
DEG provides equipment and facility analyses, assessments, and strategy recommendations based on a client’s individual needs, arranges financing, obtains incentives and grants, designs and installs energy solutions.</p>

		      			<div class="learnmore-p collapsible-body"><p class="no-shadow">Our fundamentally different approach is to deliver: Design, Develop, Arrange Financing, Install and Maintain clean low cost CoGeneration Systems that exceed expectations, which are supplied with little or no upfront costs.
 
Our vision, expertise, methodology, employees, and partners contribute to making Dynamic Energy Group a leading CoGen energy service provider.</p><p class="no-shadow">
 
Dynamic Energy Group, Inc. is a thriving new company that is leading the way to new energy alternatives. We are working with leading real estate developers and investors, Fortune 500 companies, and state & local governments to create an alternative vision of energy, one built around on-site power generation (CHP) and energy efficiency projects.</p><p class="no-shadow">
 
Real estate varies in size, configuration, type, usage, and location but none are more important than yours.  DEG begins with you, your needs and ability to establish and own a successful energy project. We then move to an onsite investigation, systems analysis and concept design for existing buildings. Our bottom-line oriented approach lets us recommend and propose energy projects that are customized for you and your building/facility. If you can’t afford it we won’t recommend it.</p><p class="no-shadow">
 
DEG helps owner/developers obtain all available incentives and subsidies from all levels of government and from private foundations. We can provide multiple routes to financing for energy infrastructure including independent project financing for all CHP and renewable energy related equipment and installation.  For on-site power and for high-performance building efficiencies technologies, we are firmly vendor-neutral, offering our clients advice on the best combination of equipment and design features with the highest return on investment. For larger projects, we can take the lead in establishing an energy investment master plan.</p><p class="no-shadow" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
 
DEG has the flexibility to offer clients the best in both design and construction.</p></div>

As a company, DEG embraces a culture that empowers our employees to take whatever action is necessary to ensure a safe work environment. 
 
DEG has programs and procedures that cover every aspect of safety on a construction project. Our safety plan focuses on personal behaviors and making intelligent choices. It includes ergonomic programs that teach us to use the right tools and subcontractor plans so we can include everyone in our pre-task safe work planning.
DEG’s Consulting Safety/Compliance Manager has an excellent working knowledge of OSHA construction standards, as well as extensive experience conducting job site inspections.
The safety of all participants in each project is our top priority. GED knows that our excellent safety record is the result of employee involvement. Through extensive employee safety training and by motivating our employees, accidents are minimized or completely avoided. All DEG’s foremen perform a weekly Safety Checklist Inspection and a detailed site inspection to ensure that all the safety requirements are being met. Our Safety Manager routinely performs pop inspections at all job sites.</p>

CoGeneration also known as Combined Heat and Power (CHP), is the production of two kinds of energy –electricity and heat – from a single source of fuel.  CHP replaces the traditional purchasing of electricity from the local electric utility and separately purchasing natural gas or other fossil fuels to burn in a boiler to produce heat. 
 
Combined Cooling Heating and Power (CCHP) takes this concept one-step further.  The useful heat recovered from the CCHP application can be used to supply space and process heating and cooling needs.  This is commonly referred to as CCHP or Tri-Generation.  The recovered heat is utilized by an absorption cycle refrigeration machine, the resulting chilled water is sent to process or space cooling circuits.  Heat not utilized in the absorber can be sent to the heating circuit where it is further used for domestic, process or space-heating as needed.
 
DEG manages every phase of the CHP/CCHP process - from analysis to project design to financing and through to development/construction and installation.</p>

				<div class="no-shadow label-round circle"><i class="material-icons no-shadow green-text">autorenew</i></div><h5 class="col l6 offset-l3">Renewable Energy</h5><p class="col l12 left-align">Renewable energy is used to describe sources of energy or power that have the capacity to replenish themselves. Renewable energy is sometimes called infinite energy, because it relies on never ending energy sources. Renewable energy is also considered clean or green energy, because it does not produce toxins or pollutants that are harmful to the environment in the same manner that non-renewable energy does. The world is converting to renewable-clean energy sources to provide power for facilities, which lowers their costs and lets them function in a more environment friendly way. Buildings and facilities most commonly use Solar, Wind and Geothermal as renewable energy.
 
Wind power is the most common form of renewable energy, by 2012 more than 5% of US electricity production will be from wind.  Wind electricity is created when the wind energy turns blades connected to a turbine (a shaft & gears) which powers an electric generator. Wind power has a potentially infinite energy supply and a number of advantages to its use.
Wind is free and in infinite supply making an affordable energy source.
Wind electricity does not produce any pollutants or green house gases.
 
Solar power is another renewable energy source, where the energy from the sun is directly harnessed in order to produce either heat (Thermal) or electricity (PV) energy. Sunlight is in limitless supply so long as it is shining, and is an excellent renewable energy source. Some areas of the world cannot rely on solar power because their weather and climate are not conducive to its use if long periods of cloudiness are present. Overall however, solar power is an endlessly free, clean energy source that does not pollute the environment or contribute to global warming.
 
Solar Thermal captures the heat from sunlight and transfers it to a conducting material usually a fluid that in turn transfers the heat to storage or a directly into buildings mechanical systems where heat is needed.
 
Solar PV-(Photovoltaics) turns photons from Sunlight directly into DC electricity and usually collected in panels that can be mounted individually or stung together by the thousands.
 
Geothermal or Ground-source heat pumps (GSHP) is the name for a broad category of space conditioning systems that employ a geothermal resource – the ground, groundwater, or surface water – as both a heat source and sink. GSHPs use a reversible refrigeration cycle to provide either heating or cooling to storage or a directly into buildings mechanical systems where heat is needed.</p>
